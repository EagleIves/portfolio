# HELLO, I'M IVY KARANJA
Your partner in turning raw data into impactful insights. SQL, Power BI, Python, and Advanced Excel are my weapons of choice. Let's get cooking!

## WHO AM I?
My penchant to make connections and predict outcomes based on historical events led me to Data Analysis. Now, with an in-depth understanding of business processes borne of years of experience working in a large corporation, I have graduated to the ranks of Business Analysis. I am your go-to girl for translating complex technical concepts to the customer-facing commercial teams and conversely, communicating core and niche business needs to technical teams. I use data analysis tools, automation tools, and AI to help businesses mine the gold hiding within their own data and therefore defy their past performance ceilings. Join me on this data adventure!
